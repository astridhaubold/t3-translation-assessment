# 8. Improvement Recommendations

## 8.1. Short-term Improvements (Quick Wins)

[Detail recommended short-term improvements that can be implemented relatively quickly and with minimal resources:]

| Recommendation | Description | Benefits | Complexity | Resource Estimate |
|---------------|------------|---------|------------|------------------|
| Recommendation 1 |           |         |            |                  |
| Recommendation 2 |           |         |            |                  |

| [Continue as needed] |       |         |            |                  |

[For each recommendation, provide more detailed information:]

### Recommendation 1: [Title]
- Detailed description of the proposed improvement
- Specific technical or functional changes required
- Expected impact on users and system
- Implementation considerations
- Dependencies and prerequisites
- Potential risks and mitigation strategies

[Repeat for each short-term recommendation]

## 8.2. Medium-term Technical Adjustments

[Detail recommended medium-term technical adjustments that require more significant effort but can be completed within reasonable timeframes:]

| Recommendation | Description | Benefits | Complexity | Resource Estimate |
|---------------|------------|---------|------------|------------------|
| Recommendation 1 |           |         |            |                  |

| [Continue as needed] |       |         |            |                  |

[For each recommendation, provide more detailed information as structured above]

## 8.3. Long-term Architectural Changes

[Detail recommended long-term architectural changes that represent significant system redesigns or reimplementations:]

| Recommendation 3 |           |         |            |                  |
| [Continue as needed] |       |         |            |                  |

[For each recommendation, provide more detailed information as structured above]

## 8.4. Implementation Prerequisites

[Identify and describe prerequisites that must be in place for successful implementation of the recommendations:]

### Technical Prerequisites
- [List and describe technical prerequisites]

### Organizational Prerequisites
- [List and describe organizational prerequisites]

### Resource Prerequisites
- [List and describe resource prerequisites]

### Knowledge Prerequisites
